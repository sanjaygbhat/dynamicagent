# Task ID: 12
# Title: Create Project README.md Documentation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 11
# Priority: low
# Description: Create a comprehensive README.md file that includes project overview, setup instructions, running instructions, API documentation, and example usage.
# Details:
Create a well-structured README.md file at the root of the project with the following sections:

1. **Project Overview**
   - Brief description of the project's purpose and functionality
   - Key features and technologies used (FastAPI, Supabase, etc.)
   - Project architecture overview (if applicable)

2. **Setup Instructions**
   - Prerequisites (Python version, etc.)
   - Environment setup:
     - How to clone the repository
     - How to install dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
     - Required environment variables (reference the .env.example file)
   - Configuration options

3. **Running the Application**
   - Development server instructions (`uvicorn main:app --reload`)
   - Production deployment considerations
   - Available command-line options

4. **API Documentation**
   - Document all available endpoints
   - Include HTTP methods, URL paths, request parameters, and response formats
   - Note that FastAPI's automatic documentation is available at `/docs` and `/redoc`
   - Include information about error handling and status codes

5. **Example Usage**
   - Code snippets showing how to interact with the API
   - cURL examples for key endpoints
   - Sample request/response pairs

Format the README.md with proper Markdown syntax, including:
- Headers and subheaders
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Tables for structured information
- Lists for sequential instructions
- Links to relevant resources

Example structure:
```markdown
# Project Name

## Overview
Brief description of the project...

## Setup
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- ...

### Installation
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file with the following variables:
...

## Running the Application
...

## API Documentation
...

## Example Usage
...
```

Ensure the README is clear, concise, and provides all necessary information for developers to understand, set up, and use the application.

# Test Strategy:
To verify the README.md file is complete and accurate:

1. **Content Verification**:
   - Confirm all required sections are present (overview, setup, running, API docs, examples)
   - Verify that environment variables mentioned match those in the .env.example file
   - Check that API endpoints documented match the actual implemented endpoints
   - Ensure all dependencies listed in requirements.txt are mentioned in setup instructions

2. **Technical Accuracy**:
   - Test the setup instructions by following them on a clean environment
   - Verify that the running instructions actually start the application correctly
   - Test any example API calls to ensure they work as documented
   - Confirm that error handling information matches the implementation in Task #11

3. **Formatting and Readability**:
   - Validate Markdown syntax using a Markdown linter
   - Review the rendered README in a Markdown viewer (like GitHub's preview)
   - Check for proper heading hierarchy, code block formatting, and table structure
   - Ensure links are working correctly

4. **Peer Review**:
   - Have another team member follow the instructions to verify clarity
   - Get feedback on completeness and understandability

5. **Documentation Consistency**:
   - Ensure terminology is consistent with the codebase
   - Verify that API documentation aligns with the actual implementation
   - Check that error codes and messages match those defined in the error handling system
