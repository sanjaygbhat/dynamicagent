# Task ID: 3
# Title: Set Up Supabase Integration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate Supabase for database and authentication by setting up the required tables and initializing the client.
# Details:
For MVP, focus on these essential steps:

1. Create a Supabase project
2. Run the provided SQL schema from the specification document to create all necessary tables
3. Initialize the Supabase client in main.py

No need to implement complex migrations or separate files for the MVP version. The SQL schema in the specification document contains all the necessary table definitions and extensions.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify Supabase connection from the application
2. Confirm all tables from the schema were created successfully
3. Test basic database operations (insert/select) through the initialized client
